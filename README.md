## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Data Collection** – Book metadata (title, author, genre, etc.) is pulled from APIs or a dataset.
2. **Preprocessing** – Data is cleaned and vectorized using TF-IDF / CountVectorizer.
3. **Recommendation Engine** – A similarity matrix (cosine similarity) finds books similar to a selected one.
4. **User Interaction** – Users input books they've read or liked; system returns suggestions.
